    <br>
    <p>The Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Centre is located a few kilometers north of the main Hikkaduwa town, with the goal of protecting some of the world's most endangered turtle species. It is one of several turtle hatcheries on the island's southern coast. It began as a community project to help maintain the biodiversity of the southern coast and has since grown into a full-fledged hatchery and rescue center with dedicated staff working around the clock to study, care for, and protect many turtle species.The hatchery and rescue center currently cares for five kinds of turtles. Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle are examples of such species. The sea turtle hatchery and rescue center's facilities are state-of-the-art, with water tanks to care for newborn turtles as well as adult turtle species rescued from the sea due to injuries. One of the more unusual sights in the center is the area where the turtles lay their eggs, which has distinct small mounds of sand piled neatly between one another. Each of these mounds is continuously watched in order to compute the hatching process of the turtle eggs.</p>

          *Great effort for conservation being done here…our tour guide Yohann did a fabulous job explaining the various types of sea turtles and how the injured and disabled ones are being taken care of while getting no support from the government…they are surviving on tickets which are marginally priced and donations.,,a must see- SHILPA FROM TRIPADVISOR

          <br>
            <br>

            *Only about £5,00 but get a guide to tell you everything you need to know about turtles you can even let the 4 day old ones into the sea.- LYN FROM TRIPCOMMENTS

            <br>
            <br>

            *Amazing conservation experience, was wonderful to be able to hold baby turtles and release them into the ocean - so cute!! Definitely a cause worth supporting, and especially good to support them now that they are open after covid! Will definitely come back next time I visit Sri Lanka!- DAVID FROM TRIPCOMMENTS

            <br>

            *This place takes good care of the turtles. At Sunset you are allowed to pick one turtle to let it swim into the sea. Dont feel sad if the Eagles that fly over catches it, its all part of the nature.- BUCKETLISTDESTINATION FROM TRIPADVISOR
