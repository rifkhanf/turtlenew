    <h2 class="intro">~INTRODUCTION~</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Turtles are one of the most primitive vertebrate species that can be found on every continent except Antarctica. The oldest turtle fossil dates back to
nearly 230 million years ago. Which is also called the "triassic period". There are approximately 245 turtle species, which are divided into 87 generics and 12 families. They live in both freshwater ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and swamps) and other terrestrial and marine environments. Turtles have developed very specific characteristics based on their environment.Another way to define turtles is they are large, air-breathing reptiles found worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas. Their shells are made up of an upper (carapace) section and a lower section (plastron). All but the leatherback have hard scales (or scutes), and the number and arrangement of these scutes can be used to determine the species. Sea turtles come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors. The olive ridley typically weighs less than 100 pounds, whereas the leatherback weighs between 650 and 1,300 pounds! The upper shell, or carapace, of each sea turtle species varies in length, color, shape, and scale arrangement.</p>

         <p> Sea turtles do not have teeth, but their jaws have modified "beaks" that are adapted to their diet. They have eardrums that are covered by skin rather than visible ears. They hear best at low frequencies and have a keen sense of smell. Their underwater vision is excellent, but they are nearsighted when they are out of the water. Their streamlined bodies and large flippers make them remarkably adapted to sea life. However, sea turtles have strong ties to land.
          Because females must come ashore to lay their eggs in the sand, all sea turtles begin their lives as tiny hatchlings on land. Many facts about marine turtles have been discovered thanks to research on these ancient creatures. The majority of this research has focused on nesting females and hatchlings emerging from nests.Thousands of sea turtles have been tagged all over the world to help researchers learn more about their growth rates, reproductive cycles, and migration routes. Much has been discovered after decades of studying sea turtles. However, many mysteries remain.

         <h3>Sea Turtles And Human</h3>
         <p> 
          Sea turtles have always attracted people and are featured in many cultures' mythology and folklore. The legend of a gentle "Turtle Mother" lives on at the Miskito Cays off Nicaragua's eastern coast. However, the spiritual value of sea turtles has not prevented them from being exploited for both food and profit. Millions of sea turtles previously roamed the world's oceans, but just a few number exist now. Human interacts with turtles in an unmannered way.</p> 
          <p>Most of the people do not respect these sea creatures, eventhough some of them are endangered.<a href="./turtlethreats.html">Read More</a> about the turtle threats. Sri Lanka has been a nation rescuing and guarding the endangered culture as much as possible. The laws have enforced by the government to protect these creatures, and if the law is ruled out, punishments are given. Most of the countries do not appoint these rules. This causes the human interaction between animals, turn into significant threats.

         <h3>Reproduction Growth And Development</h3>
         <p> 
          Only females come ashore to nest; males rarely return to land after crawling into the sea as hatchlings. The majority of females return to nest on the beach where they were born (natal beach). Nesting seasons occur at different periods around the world. Nesting season in the United States lasts from April through October. Most females nest at least twice throughout each mating season, and some may nest up to ten times. A female will not nest in consecutive years, but will usually skip one or two years before returning.Researchers do not yet know how long baby turtles spend in the open sea or where they go.</p>
          
          <p>It is thought that they spend their first, most vulnerable years floating around the sea in giant beds of sargasso weeds, where they do little more than eat and grow. When turtles reach dinner-plate size, they appear at feeding grounds in nearshore waters. They grow slowly and take between 15 and 50 years to reach reproductive maturity, depending on the species. A sea turtle's physical appearance cannot be used to determine its age. It is theorized that some species can live over 100 years.

         <h3>Status Of The Species</h3>
         <p> 
          Researchers do not still know how long baby turtles spend in the open sea or where they go after being born. It is thought that they spend their first, most important years floating around the sea in giant beds of sargasso weeds, where they do little more than eat and grow. When turtles reach dinner-plate size, they appear at feeding grounds in nearshore waters and shallow seas. They grow slowly and take between 15 and 50 years to reach reproductive maturity, depending on the species. A sea turtle's physical appearance cannot be used to determine its age. It is theorized that some species can live over 100 years.</p>
          <p>
          Under the Endangered Species Act, green, leatherback, and hawksbill sea turtles are categorized as Endangered, while loggerhead and olive ridley sea turtles are listed as Threatened. Green and loggerhead sea turtles are listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), while hawksbill and Kemp's ridley sea turtles are listed as Critically Endangered (facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future), and olive ridley sea turtles are listed as Endangered (facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future).
