    <br>
    <p>Sea turtles play an important role in marine ecosystems. They help keep seagrass beds and coral reefs healthy, which benefits commercially valuable species like shrimp, lobster, and tuna. Sea turtles are the living descendants of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years. Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners in the last 200 years. Sea turtles are poached and over-exploited because they are killed for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells. They are also threatened by habitat degradation and bycatch in fishing gear. Climate change has an effect on turtle nesting sites because it changes sand temperatures, which affects hatchling sex. Almost all sea turtle species are now classed as endangered, with three of the seven remaining species categorized as highly endangered. This page shows the different threats that turtles that made the endangered and also it contains the consequences and the prevention we must take.</p>

    <h3>1.Turtles getting entangled in fishing gear</h3>
    <p>Gill nets, prawn/shrimp trawls, and longlines have been highlighted as threats to sea turtles. Gill nets cause the most entanglements. In certain cases, fisherman may slash their own flippers to preserve their nets. Most turtles die due to not being able to breathe after getting entangled. Turtles can last 5-6 hours underwater without breathing. But after sometime they scam the surface of waters to get a breath of oxygen. This had been a major reason for turtle species to reduce to a such low figure. Most countries have implemented rules on how to use nets safeguarding the wild life. To prevent this threat we must use fishing gear appropriately. Used fishing gear must be disposed properly. The countries must implement rules in order to protect these creatures.

    <h3>2.Consumption and illegal trade of turtle eggs</h3>
    <p>Despite most countries' legislation protecting sea turtles, the illegal trade of turtle eggs, flesh, and shells remains a major threat to their existence. These creatures are collected for their meat and eggs, which are utilized for human food and are regarded a delicacy in some areas. The commerce of turtle eggs is a large industry in several nations, providing money to many people.
      In some developing-world coastal towns, people may lack access to jobs that can support their families. We do not believe that persons who collect turtle eggs to sell, consume, or hunt for their meat are evil people; choosing between supporting one's family and safeguarding a wild species is a difficult decision.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sea turtles are employed in rituals in several regions of the world. Its shells and skins are often used to manufacture jewelry, eyewear, tourist trinkets, instruments, and wall hangings. The hawksbill in particular is prized for its shell, which is used for ornamentation.

        When it comes to illegal trading, a lack of enforcement and public knowledge is particularly troublesome. Because trade occurs across borders, it is frequently impossible to oversee unlawful trade. Several conservation programs are ongoing around the world, developing projects that offer more money to local communities in tourism earnings than they would gain from harvesting the animals.</p>

    <h3>3.Coastal development</h3>
    <p>Coastal development is a broad category that covers a variety of human activities such as beachside construction of residences, hotels, restaurants, and roadways, frequently for tourism purposes. Beach replenishment, seawall building, nearshore dredging, and oil platform development are also featured. Half of the world's population lives on or within 100 miles of a coastline, and this figure is expected to rise rapidly over the next decade. Human alteration of coasts forces nesting females to utilize alternative beaches, affects the features of nesting beaches, and adds to degradation of sea turtle habitat through runoff and wastewater discharge. Increasing coastal population leads to an increase in recreational and beach-going cars.</p>
<br>
   <p>When sea turtles achieve sexual maturity, they usually return to the same beaches where they were hatched to lay eggs. Items left on beaches, like as beach chairs, present barriers for nesting females, resulting in failed nesting attempts. Obstacles on beaches can also be dangerous to hatchlings, trapping them in depressions and preventing them from reaching the water.

    Seawall construction provides insurmountable obstacles for nesting females and generates unnatural beach erosion. Boats and personal watercraft are to blame for a substantial proportion of sea turtle injuries and deaths. As coastal communities grow, so do boating activity, and collisions with sea turtles that must surface to breathe are unavoidable. The majority of sea turtle strandings in Florida are the consequence of boat collisions.</p>
<br>
    <p>Tourism development has harmed conservation efforts in many significant sea turtle hotspots throughout the world, such as Cancun, Mexico. Hydro suggests that guests thoroughly examine coastal hotels to ensure that they are not negatively damaging beach habitat and are supporting conservation initiatives. We deal with sites that do not have a big number of visitors or major hotels, and we make certain that the lodgings we employ are turtle-friendly.</p>

    <h3>4.Global Warming</h3>
    <p>Global warming has a huge impact on sea turtles and other wildlife. The rate of global warming significantly outstrips creatures' natural ability to adjust to such dramatic environmental changes. The loss of beach and sea turtle nesting habitat is already being exacerbated by sea-level rise caused by melting polar ice. Weather extremes, which are also linked to climate change, imply more frequent and powerful storms that modify nesting beaches, induce beach erosion, and inundate or flood sea turtle nests.

      Increased temperatures cause hotter sand, which results in lower hatching rates or outright nest failure. Increasing sand temperatures also have an effect on hatchlings by changing the natural sex ratios, with hotter temperatures creating more female hatchlings.</p>
      <br>
     <p>Sea turtles use ocean currents to migrate and hunt prey. Rising ocean temperatures affect migratory animals by modifying currents and influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species. As a result, southerly species may be discovered in more northern places, well outside of their normal range. Higher water temperatures also have an impact on coral reefs, which are critical to the survival of animals like the hawksbill turtle.</p>

    <h3>5.Plastic and other land debris</h3>
    <p>Plastic affects sea turtles at every stage of their lives. They crawl through plastic on their journey to the ocean as hatchlings, swim through it while migrating, mistake it for jellyfish (one of their favorite diets), and then crawl through it again as adults. Each year, thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine animals, as well as over one million seabirds, perish as a result of ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The majority of rubbish reaches the seas via rivers, with landfills and other urban sources accounting for 80% of the total. This trash, which is ingested by fish and can entangle sharks and harm coral reefs, tends to gather in gyres (areas of slow swirling water and low winds) and near coastlines.

      There are five major ocean gyres in the world. The North Pacific Gyre in the Pacific Ocean is home to the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," a vast area the size of Texas with rubbish spreading 20 feet (6 meters) down into the water column. This "plastic island" is predicted to contain 3.5 million tons of rubbish and might double in size in the next five years.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Plastic bags can fool sea turtles into thinking they're jellyfish. A turtle in the water cannot distinguish between the two and will frequently consume the bag, which becomes lodged in their stomach. Garbage washed up on nesting beaches. Adult sea turtles must crawl through collected trash to locate a site to nest in many places, and hatchlings might become entangled in the debris while attempting to make their way to the ocean. Small plastic fragments in the sand can potentially harm nests and hatchlings.While swimming, they can become entangled in it. Many turtles migrate for great distances and pass through places with a high concentration of ocean trash. They can become entangled in items such as six pack rings or discarded fishing equipment.
      Helium-filled mylar balloons can also appear.
