    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Turtles are one of the most primitive vertebrate species that can be found on every continent except Antarctica. The oldest turtle fossil dates back to
nearly 230 million years ago. Which is also called the "triassic period". There are approximately 245 turtle species, which are divided into 87 generics and 12 families. They live in both freshwater ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and swamps) and other terrestrial and marine environments. Turtles have developed very specific characteristics based on their environment.Another way to define turtles is they are large, air-breathing reptiles found worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas. Their shells are made up of an upper (carapace) section and a lower section (plastron). All but the leatherback have hard scales (or scutes), and the number and arrangement of these scutes can be used to determine the species. Sea turtles come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors. The olive ridley typically weighs less than 100 pounds, whereas the leatherback weighs between 650 and 1,300 pounds! The upper shell, or carapace, of each sea turtle species varies in length, color, shape, and scale arrangement.</p>
