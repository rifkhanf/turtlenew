    <br>
    <p>Kosgoda is a tiny town in the Galle District of Sri Lanka's Southern Province. It is located on Sri Lanka's southwestern coast, roughly 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Galle and 76 kilometers (47 miles) south of Colombo. The town is well-known for its turtle nesting places, where five of the seven species of marine turtles (green, olive ridley, loggerhead, hawksbill, and leatherback turtles) nest on the nearby beaches.It started as a community project to help preserve the southern coast's biodiversity and has since developed into a full-fledged hatchery and rescue center with devoted employees working around the clock to study, care for, and conserve several turtle species. Currently, the hatchery and rescue facility cares for five different types of turtles. Such species include the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle. The facilities at the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center are cutting-edge, including water tanks to care for newborn turtles as well as adult turtle species rescued from the sea due to injuries.

    <section><p>The Turtle Care Facility at Kosgoda Beach is one of 18 turtle hatcheries on Sri Lanka's southern coast. The center, which was founded in 1981, is located near the South Western beach community of Kosgoda. It is also highly popular since all five species of turtles that visit Sri Lanka nest in Kosgoda. This is not the case with many of the other hatcheries on the island, whose beaches only house a subset of the species.

        The center primarily serves as a hatchery and makes significant efforts to boost the rate of hatching and survival of baby turtles in their early stages. Yet, the Care Centre also treats and releases sick or injured humans back into the water.</p></p></section>

    <h3>The Hatchery Works In The Following Steps</h3><br>
      <p><ul>
       <li>Personnel patrols the beach at night in search of mother sea turtles emerging from the sea to deposit eggs.</li>
       
       <li>They guard the mother from afar during the nesting phase, until she finishes depositing the eggs and returns to the ocean.</li>
       <li> The eggs are moved from the beach to the hatchery to safeguard them from predators and reckless human behavior.</li>
        <li>Fishermen are also paid to bring any turtle eggs they locate to the hatchery.</li>
        <li>In a safe environment, the eggs develop and hatch. This may take 45-60 days.</li>
       <li> If no issues emerge, the hatched turtles are returned into the water on the same day. This is done to limit human intervention in their lives as much as possible.</li>
